# DuckDB Snowflake Extension

A powerful DuckDB extension that enables seamless querying of Snowflake databases using Arrow ADBC drivers. This extension provides efficient, columnar data transfer between DuckDB and Snowflake, making it ideal for analytics, ETL pipelines, and cross-database operations.

## Quick Start

### Installation

```sql
-- Install and load the extension
INSTALL snowflake FROM community;
LOAD snowflake;
```

### Basic Usage

```sql
-- 1. Create a Snowflake profile
CREATE SECRET my_snowflake_secret (
    TYPE snowflake,
    ACCOUNT 'your_account.snowflakecomputing.com',
    USER 'your_username',
    PASSWORD 'your_password',
    DATABASE 'your_database',
    WAREHOUSE 'your_warehouse'
);

-- 2.1 Query Snowflake data using pass through query
SELECT * FROM snowflake_scan(
    'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state = ''CA''',
    'my_snowflake_secret'
);

-- 2.2 Query Snowflake data using local duckdb SQL syntax
ATTACH '' AS snow_db (TYPE snowflake, SECRET my_snowflake_secret, READ_ONLY);

SELECT * FROM snow_db.schema.customers WHERE state = 'CA';
```

## Overview

The DuckDB Snowflake Extension bridges the gap between DuckDB's analytical capabilities and Snowflake's cloud data warehouse, allowing you to query Snowflake data directly from DuckDB without complex data movement processes.

### Key Features

- **Direct Querying**: Execute SQL queries against Snowflake databases from within DuckDB
- **Arrow-Native Pipeline**: Leverages Apache Arrow for efficient, columnar data transfer
- **Secure Authentication**: Password-based authentication with secure credential storage
- **Secret Management**: Secure credential storage using DuckDB's secrets system
- **Storage Extension**: Attach Snowflake databases as read-only storage

## Installation

### Method 1: From DuckDB Community Extensions (Recommended)

```sql
-- Install and load the extension
INSTALL snowflake FROM community;
LOAD snowflake;
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Download the pre-built extension
wget https://github.com/your-org/duckdb-snowflake/releases/latest/download/snowflake.duckdb_extension

# Load in DuckDB
LOAD 'path/to/snowflake.duckdb_extension';
```

## Configuration

### Setting Up Snowflake Credentials

#### Using Secrets (Recommended)

Create a named profile to securely store your Snowflake credentials:

**Creating a Secret:**

```sql
-- Secret with optional parameters
CREATE SECRET my_snowflake_secret (
    TYPE snowflake,
    ACCOUNT 'adbniqz-ct69933',
    USER 'myusername',
    PASSWORD 'mypassword',
    DATABASE 'mydatabase',
    WAREHOUSE 'mywarehouse',
    SCHEMA 'myschema'  -- Optional: default schema
);
```

**Listing Secrets:**

```sql
-- View all secrets
SELECT * FROM duckdb_secrets();

-- View only Snowflake secrets
SELECT * FROM duckdb_secrets() WHERE type = 'snowflake';
```

**Updating a Secret:**

```sql
-- Drop and recreate to update
DROP SECRET my_snowflake_secret;

CREATE SECRET ...
```

**Deleting a Secret:**

```sql
-- Remove a secret
DROP SECRET my_snowflake_secret;
```

## Functions Reference

### Scalar Functions

#### `snowflake_version()`

Returns the extension version information.

```sql
SELECT snowflake_version();
-- Returns: "Snowflake Extension v0.1.0"
```

### Table Functions

#### `snowflake_scan(query, profile)`

Executes SQL queries against Snowflake databases.

```sql
SELECT * FROM snowflake_scan(
    'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE state = ''CA''',
    'my_snowflake_secret'
);
```

### Storage Extension

#### `ATTACH` with Snowflake Storage Extension

Attaches a Snowflake database as a read-only storage extension.

```sql
-- Using secret
ATTACH '' AS snow_db (TYPE snowflake, SECRET my_snowflake_secret, READ_ONLY);

-- Using connection string
ATTACH 'account=myaccount;user=myuser;password=mypass;database=mydb;warehouse=mywh'
AS snow_db (TYPE snowflake, READ_ONLY);
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Queries

```sql
-- Test connection
SELECT * FROM snowflake_scan('SELECT 1', 'my_snowflake_secret');

-- Query with attached database
ATTACH '' AS snow (TYPE snowflake, SECRET my_snowflake_secret, READ_ONLY);
SELECT * FROM snow.public.customers LIMIT 10;
```

### Complex Analytics

```sql
-- Use Snowflake's computational power for complex analytics
SELECT * FROM snowflake_scan(
    '
    WITH monthly_sales AS (
        SELECT
            DATE_TRUNC(''month'', order_date) as month,
            SUM(amount) as total_sales
        FROM orders
        GROUP BY 1
    )
    SELECT
        month,
        total_sales,
        LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_month_sales
    FROM monthly_sales
    ',
    'my_snowflake_secret'
);
```

### Cross-Database Analytics

```sql
-- Combine Snowflake data with local DuckDB tables
SELECT
    sf.product_id,
    sf.sales_amount,
    local.discount_rate,
    sf.sales_amount * (1 - local.discount_rate) as discounted_amount
FROM snowflake_scan(
    'SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) as sales_amount FROM sales GROUP BY product_id',
    'my_snowflake_secret'
) sf
JOIN local_discounts local ON sf.product_id = local.product_id;
```

### Data Export Workflows

```sql
-- Export large dataset efficiently
CREATE TABLE local_fact_sales AS
SELECT * FROM snowflake_scan(
    'SELECT * FROM fact_sales WHERE year >= 2020',
    'my_snowflake_secret'
);

-- Create Parquet files from Snowflake data
COPY (
    SELECT * FROM snowflake_scan(
        'SELECT * FROM large_table',
        'my_snowflake_secret'
    )
) TO 'output.parquet' (FORMAT PARQUET);
```


## Troubleshooting

### Common Errors

**Connection Errors:**

```
Failed to initialize connection: [Snowflake] 390100 (08004): Incorrect username or password was specified.
```

**Solution**: Verify your credentials and account information.

**Query Errors:**

```
Failed to get schema: [Snowflake] 090105 (22000): Cannot perform SELECT. This session does not have a current database.
```

**Solution**: Specify a database in the connection string or use fully qualified table names.

### Debugging Tips

```sql
-- Test connection with a simple query
SELECT * FROM snowflake_scan('SELECT 1', 'my_snowflake_secret');

-- Check profile configuration
SELECT * FROM duckdb_secrets() WHERE type = 'snowflake';

-- Verify warehouse status
SELECT * FROM snowflake_scan(
    'SHOW WAREHOUSES',
    'my_snowflake_secret'
);
```

## Limitations

- **Read-only access**: All Snowflake operations are read-only
- **Pushdown for Storage Attach**: Pushdown is not implemented for storage ATTACH, SELECT queries get all the data to duckdb before applying filters like WHERE clause
- **Large result sets**: Should be filtered at source for optimal performance, consider using snowflake_scan
- ****COUNT(\*)** like column alias operations are not supported until projection pushdown is implemented

## Security Best Practices

1. **Use Strong Passwords**: Create complex passwords for your Snowflake accounts
2. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use Snowflake roles with minimal required permissions
3. **Regular Rotation**: Update passwords and credentials regularly
4. **Environment Separation**: Use different secrets for dev/test/prod environments
5. **Secure Storage**: Secrets are stored encrypted in DuckDB's internal storage
